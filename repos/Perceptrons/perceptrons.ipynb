    "# The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron was invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. It is based on the artificial neuron proposed by McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. The perceptron was the first mathematical model of a single neuron which uses the step function as activation function.The perceptron is a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function which combines a vector of weights with the feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the perceptron learning algorithm is to find the weights vector $𝑤$ that can perfectly classify the data inputs. The algorithm starts with random weights $(𝑤_1​, 𝑤_2​, …, 𝑤_n)$. It incrementally modifies the weights such that points that are misclassified move closer to the correct side of the boundary. It stops when all learning examples are correctly classified, and the input data in a n\\-dimensional space is divided with a hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows a neural network with two inputs $x_1$, $x_2$. The inputs $x_1$, $x_2$ are connected to the output by weighted edges $w_1$, $w_2$. The output unit multiplies the inputs by their weights and adds the bias, represented by $w_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function is a threshold applied to the output of the network. The step function is one of the simplest activation functions: $𝑔(𝑥) = 1$ if $x > 0$, else $0$. If the input value is greater than $0$ the output will be $1$, otherwise the output will be $0$.\n",
